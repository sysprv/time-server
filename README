time-server
===========

Net time server written in Go.
The served time can be manipulated per client (IPv4 address).
Useful for keeping some client machines synchronized to a
clock that is different from wall clock time.

When a client connects, time-server looks for a file in the
current directory with the same name as the client's IP address.
The file can contain an offset on how the time should be fudged
before being sent to the client.
The offset must be recorded in the file as
<op> <year> <op> <month> <op> <day> <op> <hour> <op> <minute> <op> <second><newline>

op can be "+", "-" or "fix".
year, month, day, hour, minute, second must be ints.

Example:
fix 2010 fix 1 fix 3 + 0 + 0 + 0

That will cause time-server to always send the date 3-Jan-2010, with the
current wall clock time.

Right now, adding and subtracting values is broken. There is no
intelligence at all there, and using these options can lead to broken
timestamps leading to untold pain and suffering.

If a file name with the client IP address is not found or if there is
some other error while parsing the offset, the TCP connection will be
closed without sending any value to the client.
